    <h1>Parliament</h1>
          <div>
            <p>Möldovistan's beautiful, modern capitol building was built in 1979 and has been in use ever since. Its design was gifted by famous Italian architect,and good friend of the country, Antonio Abruzzese Dominco Franscica III. This was during his imprisonment in Möldovistan, following his arrest in 1973. It houses the country's day to day democratic operations, and serves as a headquarters for the coutnry's, albeit few, diplomatic interactions with other nations. It is located at the fringes of the country's ancient ancestral Karpinsky Woodlands.</p>

    <h1>The Palace</h1>
          <div>
            <p>The Grand Palace was constructed in 1939 during the last days of the country's long-standing monarchy. Before the Great Revolution of 1942, this architectural wonder housed the King and his family. They were eventually overthrown and hanged by revolutionaries before the modern Möldovistani state was established. It was then turned into a museum for tourists to visit from around the world. It reported 27 visitors last year.</p>
