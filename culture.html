    <h1>Our Heritage</h1>
          <div>
            <p>Möldovistan is a nation with rich history and culture. With a unique heritage descended from Slavic and Meditteranean influences, the culture is a unique blend found nowhere else. We take pride in all aspects of our way of life despite our difficult and opressive past. Scroll for info on the culture of our beautiful land!</p>

    <h1>Our Flag</h1>
          <div>
            <p>Our beautiful flag was adopted on the first National Flag Day, January 1, 1990. It was designed by legendary German artist Klaus Mueller during his imprisonment in Möldovistan in 1983, but was not finally approved until seven years later. It is truly a work of beauty, incoporating the pan-Slavic colours of red, white and blue. The red resppresents the blood and opression the Möldovistani people have endured and continue to endure. The blue represents the waters of the Black Sea that surround the island, and the white represents the nation's purity in conscience as Möldovistan has never been guilty of any wrongdoing ever. The compass in the bottom right represents the lmitless future of nation, as well as all the directions from which we have been oppressed from.</p>

    <h1>Our Cuisine</h1>
          <div>
            <p>Möldovistani cuisine is renowned throughout the world as among the best. Think about it, what comes to mind when you think <em>"good food?</em> Italian, French, Japanese.. and of course, Möldovistani! The dishes are as varied as Her people, but are mostly based around cheese, wheat and fish. This has kept our people strong throughout the ages. Our national dish is <strong>bidkaya</strong>, which translates literally into "yucky." Its name came about from ignorant foreigners who mistook its pungent aroma and strong flavour for tasting bad. Oh, how wrong they are!</p>

    <h1>The Language</h1>
          <div>
            <p>Our wonderful language is the most beautiful in the world. Möldovistani falls under the East Slavic subfamily of Indo-European languages, but retains a lot of influence and vocabulary from Romance languages. Many a book and many a song have been written in this breathtaking language.</p>
